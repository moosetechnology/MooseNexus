############ INPUTS DOCUMENTATION ############

# pharo-version:
#  An array of strings corresponding to a Pharo or Moose image.
#    Default is the Pharo versions compatible with the latest Moose version.
#    Alternatively, you can:
#        - set the value of this option with valid Pharo or Moose versions (always an array, even if you set only 1 image).  See available images here: https://github.com/hpi-swa/smalltalkCI?tab=readme-ov-file#images
#        - assign a Moose version to your branch using repository variables. See https://github.com/moosetechnology/.github?tab=readme-ov-file#use-different-values-for-specfic-branches
#          The default Pharo version will then be the available Pharo versions corresponding to this Moose version.

# create-artifact:
#  A boolean.
#  Default is false.
#  Set it to true to build an artifact containing all the files necessary to run your image locally. Note that smalltalkCI will be deleted from this image.

# image-name:
#  A string.
#  If create-artifact is set to true, this will be the beginning of the name of the artifact and the image in it.
#  The full name of each artifact will be <imagename>-<pharo-version>. This way you get an artifact per pharo version used.
#    Default value: <RepositoryName-branchName>
#    Alternatively, you can:
#        - set the value of this option to a name valid for all branches targeted by your workflow
#        - assign an image name to your branch using repository variables. See https://github.com/moosetechnology/.github?tab=readme-ov-file#use-different-values-for-specfic-branches

# pre-upload-script:
#  A string that can be executed in Pharo.
#  If create-artifact is set to true, this will be executed in the image after the tests are run and before uploading the artifact.
#  It is mostly used when you need to register information from the workflow run. For example, store commit ID.
#  If you do not need workflow information, you can instead use smalltalkCI custom scripts: https://github.com/hpi-swa/smalltalkCI?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-scripts
#    Default value: ""

# run-coverage:
#  Compute coverage using Coveralls.
#  See https://github.com/hpi-swa/smalltalkCI/blob/master/docs/COVERAGE.md for more documentation.
#  Be sure to run on packages or classes in the repository (not loaded via dependency)
